# 👋 Hi, I’m Hüseyin Doğan

**Computer Vision & AI Engineer candidate.**  
I follow an engineering-driven approach focused on solving real-world problems through **computer vision, object detection, deep learning, and Python/C++-based systems**.

Currently, my main areas of focus include:
- 🧠 **Computer Vision & Deep Learning**
- 🎯 **Object Detection / Recognition (YOLO, CNN)**
- ⚙️ **Real-time perception systems (OpenCV, PyTorch, C++)**
- 🚀 **Model deployment and AI infrastructure development**

where I develop both experimental and production-oriented projects.

## 📌 Vision & Approach

My work prioritizes **practical results, performance, and scalability**.  
Beyond training models, I design **end-to-end pipelines** that include real-time systems, API/service integration, C++-level optimizations, and training–inference infrastructures.  

This approach allows me to bridge theory and practice while building solutions aligned with real industry requirements.

## 🧩 Featured Projects

The following projects represent my **core portfolio and strategic work**:

- 🔹 **Real-Time License Plate Detection & Recognition**  
  A real-time license plate recognition pipeline using YOLO, CNN, and OCR.  
  *(Real problem → solution → production-focused implementation)*

- 🔹 **cpp-to-vision-perception-roadmap**  
  A structured roadmap for building real-time perception systems using C++, OpenCV, LibTorch, and TorchScript.

- 🔹 **hyso**  
  A deep learning library featuring custom CNN blocks and modern attention mechanisms at the architectural level.

- 🔹 **HysoLLM Infrastructure Core**  
  A scalable AI infrastructure for transformers and other model types, supporting training, logging, checkpointing, and configuration management.

## 📚 Technical Learning & Experimental Projects

To strengthen my deep learning foundations and modeling skills, I actively develop experimental repositories such as:

- 🔸 **Advanced AI API Development** – API and inference service design for PyTorch models  
- 🔸 **Object Detection with YOLO & CNN** – End-to-end object detection pipelines  
- 🔸 **YOLO & CNN Architecture** – Backbone design and feature extraction experiments  
- 🔸 **G–L Transformer Full Pipeline** – Full training and inference pipeline for attention-based transformer models

These projects form the technical foundation behind my engineering decisions in production-oriented work.
